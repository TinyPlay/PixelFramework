# Pixel Framework
Pixel Framwork is a set of the most necessary classes for developing your games. Originally, we built this framework on the basis of our old developments, but now it has grown into an independent project. This is MVC Framework.

**Pixel Framwork includes:**<br/>
* **Game Managers** (Game State Manager, Audio Manager, Locale Manager, Graphics Manager, Network Manager, IAP Manager, Ads Manager, Analytics Manager, etc.);
* **Base UI Views** implemented via Unity UI, highly optimized for mobile devices;
* **UI Components** like Progress Bar, Switchers etc. (with examples);
* **Extended Components** like Localized Text, Web-Based Image etc.
* **Core Classes** like File Manager, Security Modules etc.
* **Utils Classes** like Coroutine Provider, UnixTime Manager etc.
* And much more;

This framework allows you to develop games for mobile devices even faster than you normally do. It includes a lot of useful classes, resources, and examples to get your project started. The framework will be especially useful for developers of hyper-casual games.
